This program decodes/plays the SRC RAI radio signal created by the INRIM.
The SRC (Segnale orario Rai Codificato) is generated every minute by the
laboratories of the INRIM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica) and
transmitted to RAI for broadcasting. Any AM/FM radio tuner incorporated or attached
to the computer can be used to receive and to decode the SRC through this
program. Alternatively, it is possible to read the raw audio data from file
or to reproduce the signal for test purposes.
